You can override the default action ('init') that enqueues the CDNJS script like so:
`
add_filter('wp_cdnjs_init_action', 'my_cdnjs_init_action');
function my_cdnjs_init_action() {
	return 'get_sidebar'; // the action tag you wish to use
}
`

Yes. You can use this filter:
`
add_filter('wp_cdnjs_allow_in_admin', 'my_cdnjs_allow_in_admin');
function my_cdnjs_allow_in_admin() {
	return TRUE;
}
